# Iris Flower Classification using Single Layer Perceptron with Python

A single layer perceptron is a simple neural network that contains only one layer. The calculation on this single layer perceptron uses the number of input vectors with the appropriate weight vector. The displayed output value will be used as input for the calculation of the activation function.

This repository contains scripts or source code about the classification of Iris flowers using a single layer perceptron. The features used in the classification are Sepal Width and Petal Width. The dataset used is from https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris with minor adjustments in the system.
